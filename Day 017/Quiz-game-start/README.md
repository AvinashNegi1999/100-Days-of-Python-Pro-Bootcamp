# ðŸš€ Day 17 â€“ Quiz Game (OOP)

Today I built a simple **Quiz Game** using **Object-Oriented Programming** in Python.  
This project is part of Angela Yuâ€™s 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp.

## ðŸ“š Concepts Covered:
- Python Classes & Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Loops & conditionals
- OOP Design for game logic

## ðŸ§  How It Works:
- Questions are stored as objects using a custom `Question` class.
- A `QuizBrain` class manages the question flow and score tracking.
- The game asks questions one by one and checks if the userâ€™s answer is correct.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Features:
- Tracks user score
- Clean structure using OOP
- Easy to expand with more questions
