# 100 Days of Python - Day 26

## Project: NATO Phonetic Alphabet Translator

### Description
This project reads a CSV file containing the NATO phonetic alphabet and creates a Python dictionary mapping letters to their phonetic code words.  
It then takes user input (a word) and converts each letter into the corresponding NATO phonetic code.

### Features
- Reads `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv` to build a dictionary
- Accepts user input and converts it to uppercase
- Translates each letter into the phonetic alphabet word
- Handles invalid characters by warning the user and skipping them

### How to Run
1. Make sure you have `pandas` installed:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
