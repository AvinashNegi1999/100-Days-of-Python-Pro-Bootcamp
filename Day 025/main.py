# ------------------------------------------------------------
# U.S. States Game â€” Steps
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Ensure map image (blank_states_img.gif) & CSV (50_states.csv) exist with correct paths.
# 2. Import turtle (GUI) & pandas (CSV handling).
# 3. Create game window & set title.
# 4. Load map image as turtle shape.
# 5. Read CSV, get list of all states, and make guessed_states list.
# 6. Loop until 50 states guessed or player exits:
#    - Ask for state name (show score in title).
#    - If 'Exit': save missing states to CSV & break.
#    - If valid guess: add to guessed list, get coordinates, and write name on map.
# 7. Keep window open after game ends.

# ----------------------- Data Setup -----------------------
