### 📅 Day 19 - Turtle Race Setup 🐢🏁

Today, I created a fun turtle race setup using Python's `turtle` module.
I initialized 7 turtles, each representing a rainbow color, and positioned them on the screen.
The user is prompted to place a bet by selecting a turtle color.

---

### 📌 What I Learned:

* How to create and position multiple turtle objects.
* How to use `.penup()` to prevent drawing while moving.
* How to accept user input using `textinput()` from the turtle `Screen`.
* Working with colors and basic screen setup in `turtle`.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts:

* `Turtle()`, `penup()`, `goto()`
* `screen.setup()`, `screen.textinput()`
* Organizing multiple turtle instances
* Basic UI interaction using turtle

---

### 🚀 Next Step:

Add logic to make the turtles race with random speeds and display the winner.
