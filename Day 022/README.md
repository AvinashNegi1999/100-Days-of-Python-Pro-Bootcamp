## 🚀 Day 22 - Build Pong: The Famous Arcade Game

Recreated the classic **Pong** arcade game using Python and the `turtle` module. A fun dive into object-oriented programming, game logic, and collision detection!

### 🧠 Concepts Practiced
- Creating a Paddle that responds to key presses
- Writing the `Paddle` class and adding a second paddle
- Writing the `Ball` class and animating the ball
- Bouncing logic for walls and paddles
- Collision detection with paddles
- Detecting out-of-bounds events
- Score keeping and dynamic ball speed

### 🕹️ Features
- Two-player paddle control  
- Real-time ball movement  
- Dynamic speed increase on paddle hit  
- Scoreboard that resets when a player misses
