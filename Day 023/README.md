# Day 23 – Angela Yu 100 Days of Python Code Challenge

## 📝 Project: Turtle Crossing Game
Today’s challenge was to build a **Turtle Crossing Game** using Python’s `turtle` graphics module.  
The player controls a turtle that must cross a busy road filled with moving cars. Each time the turtle successfully crosses, the game gets faster, increasing the difficulty.

## 📚 Concepts Practiced
- **Turtle graphics** (`turtle` module)  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
  - Class creation  
  - Methods and attributes  
- **Inheritance**  
- **Collision detection**  
- **Game loop control** with `while`  
- Managing multiple objects (cars)  
- Increasing difficulty dynamically

---

## 🛠 Features
- 🐢 **Player Control:** Move the turtle upward with the `Up` arrow key.  
- 🚗 **Car Movement:** Cars spawn randomly and move from right to left.  
- ⏫ **Level Progression:** Speed increases each time the player crosses successfully.  
- 💥 **Game Over Detection:** If a car collides with the turtle, the game ends.
