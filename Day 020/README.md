# 💻 Day 20 - Snake Game: Movement with Segments

Today, I implemented smooth movement in the classic Snake Game using Python's `turtle` module. The snake is now made of multiple segments that follow the head properly.

### ✅ What I Learned

* Creating and managing multiple turtle objects (segments)
* Making each segment follow the previous one
* Controlled animation using `time.sleep()` and `screen.update()`

### 🎮 Features

* Smooth continuous snake movement
* Snake follows direction keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`)
* Structure separated using OOP (Snake class)

### 🐍 Output Preview

> A black screen with a moving snake made of white square blocks.
